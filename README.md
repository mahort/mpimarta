### Assigning taxonomic status to short read sequences 
Authors: Matt Horton,

This Java program uses a local NCBI nt/nr database to assign taxonomic status to short-read sequences.
This code extends [marta](https://github.com/mahort/marta) to use NCBI's mpiblast.

The current version is 1.0. Suggestions and code contributions are welcome.

The main dependencies are:
Java
MySQL
